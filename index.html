              <h1>ABOUT Night Walkers</h1>

              <p style="color: #d3d3d3;">In the village of Kasukawi, a young boy named Korma is scared. He is terrified
                because his friend Sal told him about the possibility of zombies taking over their town. Korma, with his
                limited knowledge of this weird creature, is guiding his little sister Anna to protect herself. All he
                knows is that zombies represent frightening realities - namely the dangers of viral infections, anger
                and violence and death by trauma. He is also aware of the fact that a zombie turns its victims into
                mindless cannibals. In this state, zombies don't die even when fatally wounded or after being shot,
                blown up or cut open. They keep coming back for more.</p>

              <p style="color: #d3d3d3;">The apocalyptic predictions have made many people wary of waking up on the
                wrong side of this petrifying event. The head of the village Gash has declared a state of emergency.
                Schools have declared lockdowns or closings during the night so students can get some sleep.
                Additionally, parents are instructed to keep their children in constant contact with them, so no one is
                alone at night. All health workers should wear protective gear when dealing with zombies in case someone
                turns deadly again. Although only theoretical at this point, scientists are working on ways to reverse
                the effects of a zombie bite so its victims can die peacefully.</p>

              <p style="color: #d3d3d3;">Before a solution could be found, the apocalypse happened. Hundreds of zombies
                invaded the village and wiped off more than half of the townâ€™s population. Even the influential Gash was
                caught by one of the zombies and got infected by the virus. They even invaded the judicial offices and
                the parliament. With everything on a complete shutdown, the whole town is at a standstill. Everyone has
                become even more cautious, not even going out for basic supplies rather relying on their previous
                stocks.</p>

              <p style="color: #d3d3d3;">During all this chaos, zombies had herded around the house where Korma and his
                little sister Anna were living along with their parents. With a heroic attempt by his friend Sal, he
                managed to save the siblings while their parents fell victim at the hands of the ruthless zombies.
                Extremely emotional and scared, the 3 set out on a journey away from the zombies on the family car.</p>

              <p style="color: #d3d3d3;">They managed to get rid of the herd just on the outskirts of town where they
                soon found a cave to settle in. With limited resources available and the cries of people getting closer
                to their safe haven, they blocked the entrance with the car. Upon searching inside the cave, they
                salvaged some food from previous inhabitants of the place and luckily a cell phone through which they
                were able to reach out to a police officer in town. They explained their situation and pleaded for the
                Nightwalkers to come to their rescue.</p>

              <p style="color: #d3d3d3;">The Nightwalkers, a group of heroic individuals who choose to revolt against
                the threat of zombies taking over the world, use fire and sulfur gas to fend off the zombies. This
                technique alters the brain chemistry of the zombie by quenching their thirst of feeding on humans. With
                high hopes and a bunch of fearless individuals, they have set out on their quest to extinguish this
                plague once and for all.</p>

              <p style="color: #d3d3d3;">Along with Sal, Korma and his sister, many others are stranded in the similar
                situation surrounded by zombies with little to no hope of survival and they need urgent help. The
                Nightwalker community is reaching out to the people of the world to step up and contribute in this cause
                against fighting this epidemic.</p>

              <h1>WALKERSDAO</h1>

              <p style="color: #d3d3d3;">After the NightWalkers overcame a deadly zombie apocalypse, they formed the
                NightWalkers DAO coalition to make sure a state of mayhem never returns to their beloved planet. By
                creating a Play-To-Earn game that takes others through the experience of looking death directly in the
                eye, the NightWalkers will leave their mark and ensure safety for their future generations.</p>
              <p style="color: #d3d3d3;">The top 100 holders of $Walker will be part of the exclusive DAO which will
                have a direct say in the utility and gameplay aspects of the NightWalker P2E revolution. Together with
                the community, NightWalkers will bring safety to the entire ETH ecosystem.</p>
